              Hi there. I am an second year Software Engineering student from
              Tampere University of Applied Sciences. Lately I have been
              focusing on Fullstack Developing. My experience spans across
              multiple technologies, frontend with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React,
              Vue and Python, Node, Express for backend. Here you can see some
              of my <a href="#">projects</a>.
            </p>
            <p className="py-3">
              I enjoy using new tools and techniques to build sites that are
              both aesthetically pleasing and functional. I also place a high
              value on collaboration and communication between myself and my
              clients, which is why I consider it essential to build sites that
              are not only easy to use but also user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feel free to snoop around on my social media even though there is
              nothing there haha. For inquiries or a how you doing, contact me,
              I will be happy to hear from you.
            </p>
